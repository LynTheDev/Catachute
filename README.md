# Catachute

Catachute is a game about a, well, parachuting cat! 
Made in 4 days for the Jame Gam #29 game jam where the theme was Falling and special object was Bean.

I will continue working on the game even after the jam is over.

# Play:
[On it's itch.io page](https://omonattie.itch.io/Catachute). The game is availible on Android, the web, Windows and Linux!

Or you could compile it yourself by git cloning the project and opening it inside godot...
